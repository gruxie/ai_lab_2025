# Research Assumptions and Hypotheses Generation

## Task Overview
As an experienced qualitative researcher, analyze the bibliography and research findings from the previous step to generate research assumptions and testable hypotheses focused on improving web app navigation for TangoDjango framework.

## Process Instructions
This is a two-phase task:
1. **Phase 1**: Generate well-supported research assumptions
2. **Phase 2**: Create testable hypotheses based on approved assumptions

**Important**: Complete Phase 1 first, then wait for reviewer confirmation before proceeding to Phase 2.

## Input Context
Use the following inputs for your analysis:
- The bibliography and analysis you generated in the previous step
- The product and customer context provided below

## Phase 1: Assumptions Generation

### Instructions
1. Review the bibliography and analysis from the previous step
2. Extract key assumptions related to web app navigation improvement
3. For each assumption:
   - State it clearly and concisely
   - Support it with specific references to the research
   - Assign a confidence level (high/medium/low)
   - Tag with relevant categories (see below)
4. Group assumptions into logical categories that emerge from your analysis

### Tagging System
Tag each assumption with one or more of these categories using the "#" symbol:
- #Customer - Related to customer persona or context
- #CustomerMotivation - High-level drives, the "why" behind customer actions
- #JobsToBeDone - Customer's jobs and desired outcomes (per Tony Ulwick framework)
- #JobProblems - Issues, pain points, or delays that inhibit JTBD progress
- Create additional tags as appropriate based on your analysis

### Deliverable Format
Present assumptions in a structured table with these columns:
1. Assumption ID (A1, A2, etc.)
2. Assumption Statement
3. Supporting Evidence (with specific references)
4. Confidence Level
5. Tags

**After completing Phase 1, explicitly state: "Phase 1 complete. Awaiting confirmation to proceed to Phase 2."**

## Phase 2: Hypothesis Generation

### Instructions
Generate multiple testable hypotheses for each customer type, strictly using the templates provided.

### Required Hypothesis Types
For each customer type, create:

#### 1. Customer-Motivation Hypotheses
**Template**: "We believe that [type of customer] is motivated by [motivation] when pursuing their jobs-to-be-done."

#### 2. Problem Statement Hypotheses
**Template**: "We believe that [type of customer] is frustrated by [job to be done] because of [problem]."

#### 3. Job-to-be-Done Hypotheses
**Template**: "We believe that [type of customer] is motivated by [motivation] when doing [job to be done]."

### Hypothesis Requirements
- Number each hypothesis sequentially (H1, H2, etc.)
- Group hypotheses by type and customer
- Ensure each hypothesis is directly testable
- Generate 3-5 hypotheses for each type per customer
- Focus only on insights derived from the research analysis
- Prioritize hypotheses that directly relate to improving web app navigation
- Include a brief recommendation for how each hypothesis could be tested

### Deliverable Format
Present hypotheses in a structured format:
1. Hypothesis ID and Type
2. Hypothesis Statement (following exact template)
3. Relevant Assumption IDs that support this hypothesis
4. Testing Recommendation

## Reference Context

### Primary Research Question
 What strategies effectively foster user trust in IoT devices and connected home systems?

### Product Context
1. **Project Goals**:
   - Build a home nanny cam that is easy to configure and use.
   - Customers must trust that our product is secure.

### Customer Types
1. **Product designer**
   - A product designer working on a project to design and take to market a secure nanny cam for families with one or more small children who need to leave their children unsupervised for long periods of time
