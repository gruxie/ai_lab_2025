Workshop 1: Study preparation
How this session will work (5 min)

We will cover the prompts from three of our previous lab sessions: literature review, hypothesis generation and JTBD hypothesis generation.
We will work individually on the same research question so we can compare results after each section
The group gets to choose the research question from among three options.
Materials (papers, books) will be provided for you - you are free to seek out additional papers, books if you like.
We have 15 min for each section. Each step will have a basic outline
Setup (3 min)
Lab guide (instructions) (7 min)
Group reflection (5 min)
Collaboration environment

We will capture information in Mural
Prompt Troubleshooting:
Shallow results? - additional prompts to get more out of the results:
Re-run the prompt - see if it produces better results; try an alternate LLM (e.g. Claude)
Add context: what did you hope or expect to see but didn't?
Ask the AI to reflect on itself; have it think about their results for the literature it's produced and recommend improvements on either its results or your prompt.
Ask the AI to refresh it's results - for example:
include key findings from the [article of your choice] that relate to my research question.
Include direct quotes from the [article of your choice]
Off track?
Review the output for anchors or the term that took the LLM off track and re-word
Explain what you wanted to see but didn’t and ask it to incorporate your feedback and re-generate its results.

Section 1: Annotated literature review (15 min)
Section 1 Setup (3 min)
Big picture: this prompt is meant to give you a starting point when you are new to the material. The expectation is that you would find articles or materials through this process that you would later evaluate more deeply in order to learn and improve your confidence in the LLM's results. This is not intended to replace learning about your subject area!

Reminders: AI can hallucinate. Think of it as a launching-off point (not a final destination). Double check findings as you proceed and remain skeptical.

Materials for section 1
Use the appropriate prompt for section 1:

Prompt 1 - Option 1
Prompt 2 - Option 2
Prompt 3 - Option 3
Section 1 Instructions (7 Min)
Choose your domain area - you will use this for the entire lab!
Run the prompt for your scenario for the first time…
Think aloud!
Then evaluate the results:
Identify 2 or more insights from the literature review that are interesting and relevant to your research question. Add them to the Mural board!
Choose one paper and drill down on key findings through dialogue. For example…
What hypotheses could we draw from [this paper] that are relevant to my research question?
What other research questions does [this paper] raise that are relevant to my research question?
Add one or more of the results of the drill down onto the Mural board
Section 1 Reflection questions (5 min)
What, if anything, did you learn? If this was our project How do we feel about the quality of these results?
What concerns do you have about results so far?
What would make the results better?

Section 2: Hypothesis generation (15 min)
Big picture: This prompt will generate a list of assumptions and hypotheses (using the HPF format) based on the context set in the literature review built in Section 1.

This prompt requires continuity from the previous step (literature review) for its context. Before running this prompt, ensure you have completed the previous step in Section 1. You will run this prompt in the SAME chat session!

Section 1 created a literature review that you will use in Section 2 to generate hypotheses.

Section 2 Instructions (7 Min)
