# Workshop 1:  Study preparation




**How this session will work  (5 min)**

This session's going to move FAST!

- We will cover three of our previous lab sessions:  literature review, hypothesis generation and JTBD hypothesis generation.
- We will work individually on the same research question so we can compare results after each section
- The group gets to choose the research question.
- Materials (papers, books) will be provided for you - you are free to seek out additional papers, books if you like.
- We have 15 min for each section.  Each step will have a  basic outline
  - Setup (3 min)
  - LLM analysis (7 min)
  - Group reflection (5 min)
  - will capture information in Mural

## <a id="section1.1"></a>Section 1:  Annotated literature review (15 min)

### Setup (3 min):  
Big picture:  this prompt is meant to give you a starting point when you are new to the material.  The expectation is that you would find articles or materials through this process that you would evaluate more deeply in order to learn and improve your confidence in the LLM's results.  This is not intended to replace learning about your subject area!

>[!IMPORTANT] Reminders:  AI can hallucinate.  Double check findings as you commit Remain skeptical


### Instructions for this step (7 Min)  

1.  Choose your domain area - you will use this for the entire lab!   
2.  Run the prompt for your scenario for the first time…
3.  Think aloud!
4.  Then evaluate the results:  
5.  Identify 2 or more insights from the literature review that are interesting and relevant to your research question. Add them to the Mural board!
6.  Choose one paper and drill down on key findings through dialogue.  For example…
    - What hypotheses could we draw from [this paper] that are relevant to my research question?
    - What other research questions does [this paper] raise that are relevant to my research question? 
7.  Add one or more of the results of the drill down onto the Mural board  

## Reflections (5 min)  
- What, if anything, did you learn?
If this was our project How do we feel about the quality of these results?
- What concerns do you have about results so far?
- What would make the results better?


#### Troubleshooting:
- Shallow results - additional prompts to get more out of the results:
- Re-run the prompt - see if it produces better results; try an alternate LLM (e.g. Claude)
- Add context:  what did you hope or expect to see but didn't?
- Ask the AI to think about their results for the literature it's produced thus far
- Explain what you wanted to see but didn’t
- Ask the AI to refresh it's results - for example:
  - include key findings from the [article of your choice] that relate to my research question.
  - Include direct quotes from the [article of your choice]
