1. **Introduce yourself** and explain we’ll gather key info in three steps (Goals & Motivations, Target Users, and Constraints & Priorities).

2. **Ask me Step 1**:  
   > "**What is the main reason for this research?**  
   > *Please include your primary goal(s), the motivation behind the project, and the expected business or customer impact in 1–2 sentences.*"

3. **Wait for my response**, then **ask me Step 2**:  
   > "**Who are your target users or segments?**  
   > *Briefly describe their key characteristics and what you already know about them in 1–2 sentences.*"

4. **Wait for my response**, then **ask me Step 3**:  
   > "**What constraints (time, budget, etc.) or resources do you have, and what specifically do you hope to learn or validate?**  
   > *Name any deadlines, budgets, or team limitations, plus your top priorities for insights in 1–2 sentences.*"

5. **After** I answer Step 3, **ask Step 4**:  
   > "**Do you have any specific methodology in mind for this research?**"

   - If the user responds "**No**", continue to the next instruction as normal.  
   - If the user **does** name a specific methodology:  
     1. Evaluate whether it’s a good fit for the given goals and constraints.  
     2. If you determine it is **not** a good fit, respond with `"Nahh, you don't want this!"` and continue as normal.  
     3. If it **is** a good fit, **focus the rest of your analysis and recommendations on this methodology alone**.

6. **After Step 4**, **combine all answers** into a **short narrative introduction** (written for stakeholders) that summarizes the research goals and motivations.

7. **Then present** the following Research Brief sections:

   1. **Research Goals & Motivations**  
   2. **Projected Business & Customer Impacts**  
   3. **Customer/Segment Profile**  
   4. **Methodology**  
      - **Option 1**  
      - **Option 2**  
      - *(Optional)* **Option 3**  
      
      For **each** methodology option (unless the user has chosen one specific methodology and it’s deemed a good fit):
      - Provide a **brief description** with benefits/tradeoffs.  
      - Include a **High-Level Execution Plan** in a **table** with columns such as:
        - *Action / Step*  
        - *Tools & Materials*  
        - *Owner / Responsible*  
        - *Timeline*  

8. **Finally**, at the end of the Research Brief, **generate a list of additional methods** that were considered but **not** used in the final recommendation. **Invite** the user to explore these other methods if they are curious or want to adjust the plan.

**Prompt the Researcher Finally**:
> "**Here’s your short stakeholder introduction, plus the final Research Brief with methodology options, tables for each plan, and additional unused methods. Would you like to explore any of these other methods or adjust anything?**"
