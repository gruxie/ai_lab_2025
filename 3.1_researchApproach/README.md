# Lab 3.1 - Study design / Briefing doc 

In this exercise you will use the attached prompt to generate a study brief, a short description of a study's motivation, goals, methods and a Todo list.  The researcher needs to only bring a narrative description of what they hope to accomplish and the LLM will either design a study brief around the methods you choose to use or it will propose methods for you.  The intention is that this would be a starting point for creating a project artefact for any number of studies. 

## Exercise 1:  Create a study brief from a list of recommendations  
1.  Choose a scenario from examples 1 or 2 (or bring your own)  
2.  Paste the prompt into Claude, Chat GPT or CoPilot  
3.  Run the prompt and answer the questions  
4.  Evaluate the results:  what's missing, if anything, from what you would expect from a study plan?   

## Exercise 2: create a study brief from a specific choice  
The prompt is designed to accept your methodological suggestion and generate a study plan accordingly.  What methods, other than the ones detailed in the brief, would you use instead?  Ask the LLM to use a different method and see what it produces!  

## Exercise 3:  the inappropriate option   
The prompt is designed to consider any study proposal you make and make a judgment on whether it's a good fit.  Re run the prompt from the previous exercise.  When asked if there is a specific methodology you want to use - give it an inappropriate option - be creative!  

### Examples:
**Example 1:  The weather app** 
- Reason for the research:  I'm building a weather app and I'm not sure what parameters (forecasts, precipitation , pollen count, or moon phase) matter most to my customers.  I need to know which parameters are most important to them and which ones aren't.  
- Customer:  they are consumers who are not weather experts - normal people.  They are running busy families and love to use technology to solve their problems  
- Constraints: we need to have results back in four weeks.  we don't have finished working software but we could put together prototypes if that's helpful  

**Example 2:  Password management woes**
- Customers aren't using our cloud storage technology and we aren't sure why.  We think it may be
- Reason:   Adoption of our 2FA and password management app is lower than expected and we aren't sure why.  Some stakeholders believe that it's not marketed well enough and other stakeholders believe that the interaction is too complicated for users to understand.
- Customer:  Information workers who are low confidence computer users
Constraint:   We have limited telemetry on use of the app but we can see active daily users.  We have two months to bring back results.
