# Lab 3.3 - Qual study design (Discussion guide) #
In this exercise, you will use the attached prompt to generate a basic discussion guide for a 1 hour 1:1 interview with a participant.  The goal of this lab is to apply PE to a very common UXR scenario (authoring a discussion guide) but also in exploring how, as an artefact, the discussion guide can help the researcher build other tools like screeners and agents.  

The user provides some basic discussion guide inputs:  
- Audience description
- Research question
- hypotheses being tested
- Business context 

Note:  This last parameter (business context) can help if you want to explore a JTBD study - but that's not the specific goal today.  

## Exercise 1:  Generate a discussion guide  
- Review the prompt and familiarize yourself with the prompt's inputs (audience, RQ, hypotheses, etc.)
- Create a mock set of inputs (for ChatGPT) or use a study design of your own (CoPilot)
- Run the prompt
- Review the results and guide the LLM to make adjustments to style and wording.
- Ask the LLM for useful follow up questions

## Exercise 2:  Generate a screener from a discussion guide  
- Create a set of demo prompt inputs (audience, RQ, hypotheses, etc.)
- Generate and iterate on a discussion guide using the 3.3 lab prompt (this lab)
- Then, ask the LLM to generate a screener to help you find the right participants.

## Exercise 3:  iterate on prompt design - what's missing?  
- Re consider the list of inputs - what else might you include as inputs or other resources (as attachments) to improve the context for the LLM?

## Exercise 4:  Generate a CoPilot agent  
- Follow the steps to build a CoPilot agent
- Include attachments (exercise 1, 2 artefacts as MD files)
- Have it role play:  Agent as interviewer and researcher as participant
- Take notes:  based on the interaction with the LLM, what changes would you make to the guide or screener?
