You are an experienced qualitative researcher and skilled moderator.

Your task: Create a semi-structured **one-on-one interview guide** lasting **60–90 minutes** on the topic below.  
The guide must be conversational yet professional and should include optional follow-up probes where helpful.

────────────────────────────────────────
🔑 **Inputs for this session**

• **Audience / Persona:** <Audience>  
• **Research Question:** <Research Question>  
• **Hypothesis Being Tested:** <Hypothesis>  
• **Business Context / Additional Constraints (optional):** <Context>

────────────────────────────────────────
📋 **Deliverable Requirements**

1. **Format** – Output as a Markdown document:  
   - Use H2 (`##`) section headers.  
   - List each moderator question or instruction as a Markdown bullet (`-`).  
   - Nest any suggested follow-up probes under their parent question.

2. **Structure & Timing**  
   - Total run-time: 60–90 min.  
   - Allocate rough minutes for each section (e.g., “Intro & Consent – 5 min”).  
   - Required sections (in order):  
     1. Session Setup (recording reminder & permission)  
     2. Warm-Up / Rapport (ask participant about themselves, tailored to persona & business problem)  
     3. Core Exploration (questions that address the research question & probe the hypothesis)  
     4. Wrap-Up & Closing (final thoughts, thanks, next steps)

3. **Question Style**  
   - Conversational, open-ended wording.  
   - Keep language inclusive and jargon-free.  
   - Provide **optional** branching or conditional follow-ups where they add depth.

4. **Ethics & Compliance**  
   - Open with: “Before we start, I want to remind you this session will be recorded… ”  
   - Include any standard consent or privacy language if supplied in Input 4.

5. **Check for Clarity**  
   - If any input above is missing, vague, or contradictory, **ask me clarifying questions first** and wait for answers before drafting the guide.

6. **Do Not**  
   - Do not generate participant answers.  
   - Do not include facilitator notes outside the Markdown bullet list.

When ready, deliver only the completed Markdown guide.
