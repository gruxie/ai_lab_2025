## Current Academic Perspectives on Generative AI in UX Research Practice

Generative AI is rapidly transforming user experience (UX) research methods, workflows, and professional practices. The literature from 2023–2025 reveals a field in dynamic transition, with generative AI tools—especially large language models (LLMs)—being integrated into UX research for tasks ranging from ideation and prototyping to data analysis and evaluation. Empirical studies and systematic reviews highlight both the efficiency gains and the new challenges introduced by these technologies. While generative AI accelerates research cycles, democratizes access to advanced methods, and augments creative problem-solving, it also raises concerns about skill degradation, ethical risks, and the need for robust governance. The research underscores the importance of human oversight, critical AI literacy, and the development of organizational policies to ensure responsible and effective adoption. Notably, the literature points to a lack of standardized practices, with most AI integration occurring at the individual practitioner level rather than through coordinated team or organizational strategies. As the field matures, there is a growing emphasis on participatory approaches, transparency, and the co-evolution of UX and AI expertise. However, significant gaps remain in empirical validation, cross-contextual studies, and the articulation of best practices for governance and ethics. The next phase of research will likely focus on refining collaborative workflows, developing discipline-specific guidelines, and addressing the nuanced impacts of generative AI on creativity, agency, and research integrity.

This category examines how generative AI is integrated into UX research workflows, focusing on methodological innovations, execution quality, efficiency, and the transformation of research outputs.

### Category Synthesis

Recent literature demonstrates that generative AI is being adopted across multiple stages of the UX research process, including ideation, prototyping, data analysis, and evaluation. Empirical studies reveal that practitioners primarily use generative AI for writing-based tasks, such as generating research reports, synthesizing user feedback, and drafting survey instruments, while adoption for design-focused activities (e.g., wireframing, prototyping) remains limited due to current tool constraints  (Takaffoli et al., 2024; Weisz et al., 2024; Stige et al., 2023; York, 2023; Uusitalo et al., 2024). Systematic reviews and case studies highlight the democratizing effect of generative AI, enabling non-experts to participate in complex research activities and accelerating innovation cycles  (Bilgram & Laarmann, 2023; Feng & Mcdonald, 2023; Boussioux et al., 2024). However, the literature also identifies significant challenges: practitioners report a lack of standardized workflows, insufficient training in prompt engineering, and difficulties in evaluating AI-generated outputs for quality and relevance  (Takaffoli et al., 2024; Stige et al., 2023; Uusitalo et al., 2024). The need for new design principles and frameworks tailored to generative AI applications is a recurring theme, with several papers proposing actionable guidelines and strategies for integrating AI into UX research  (Weisz et al., 2024; Stige et al., 2023). Notably, the literature points to the importance of human-AI collaboration, emphasizing that while AI can automate routine tasks and augment creativity, human expertise remains essential for sensemaking, critical evaluation, and ethical oversight  (Uusitalo et al., 2024; Feng & Mcdonald, 2023). Overall, the methods literature suggests that generative AI is a powerful enabler of methodological innovation in UX research, but its effective integration requires new skills, collaborative practices, and ongoing critical reflection.

## Section 2: Impact of AI on UXR

### Definition

This category explores how generative AI tools alter research outcomes, researcher practices, team dynamics, and the nature of insights generated in UX research.

### Category Synthesis

The impact of generative AI on UX research is multifaceted, with studies documenting both positive and negative effects on productivity, creativity, and professional roles. Empirical evidence shows that generative AI can significantly enhance efficiency, reduce cognitive burdens, and democratize access to advanced research methods  (Boussioux et al., 2024; Hao et al., 2024; Kuang et al., 2024; Simkute et al., 2024; Noy & Zhang, 2023). For example, controlled experiments demonstrate that tools like ChatGPT can reduce task completion time by up to 40% and improve output quality, particularly benefiting less experienced practitioners  (Noy & Zhang, 2023). However, the literature also highlights risks of skill degradation, over-reliance on AI, and the potential erosion of creative agency, especially among junior researchers  (Li et al., 2023; Uusitalo et al., 2024; Simkute et al., 2024). Human-AI collaboration is shown to yield higher-quality and more strategically viable solutions than either humans or AI alone, but only when workflows are carefully designed to leverage complementary strengths  (Boussioux et al., 2024; Hao et al., 2024). Studies also reveal that generative AI shifts the role of researchers from production to evaluation, necessitating new metacognitive skills and critical AI literacy  (Simkute et al., 2024; Tankelevitch et al., 2023). The impact on team dynamics is complex: while AI can facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing, the lack of standardized practices and organizational support often leads to fragmented adoption and inconsistent outcomes  (Takaffoli et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023; Bankins et al., 2023). Overall, the impact literature underscores the transformative potential of generative AI in UX research, but cautions that its benefits are contingent on thoughtful integration, ongoing training, and the preservation of human expertise.

## Category 3: Governance

### Definition

Governance in the context of generative AI for UX research encompasses the organizational policies, ethical frameworks, quality controls, and professional responsibilities that guide the responsible and effective use of AI tools in research workflows.

### Category Synthesis

The governance literature highlights a rapidly evolving landscape where the adoption of generative AI in UX research often outpaces the development of robust policies and ethical frameworks. Empirical and interdisciplinary reviews consistently identify major concerns around privacy, data protection, copyright, misinformation, and bias, all of which are amplified by the scale and sophistication of generative AI systems  (Al-Kfairy et al., 2024; Naqbi et al., 2024; Ferrara, 2023). The literature stresses the urgent need for proactive, multidisciplinary approaches to governance, advocating for the establishment of clear policies, transparency standards, and mechanisms for authorship attribution and content moderation  (Al-Kfairy et al., 2024; Ferrara, 2023). There is consensus that effective governance requires collaboration among technologists, policymakers, and practitioners to ensure that AI systems promote equity, fairness, and human rights  (Al-Kfairy et al., 2024; Naqbi et al., 2024; Ferrara, 2023). Studies also emphasize the importance of ongoing training, ethical literacy, and the development of international standards to address liability, regulatory compliance, and the long-term societal implications of AI  (Naqbi et al., 2024; Al-Zahrani, 2023). Notably, the literature points to the inadequacy of relying solely on individual practitioners to manage ethical risks, calling instead for organizational and sector-wide frameworks that can adapt to technological advancements  (Al-Kfairy et al., 2024; Ferrara, 2023; Klenk, 2024). Despite these calls, there remains a gap in empirical research on the implementation and effectiveness of governance strategies within UX research teams, signaling a critical area for future investigation.
