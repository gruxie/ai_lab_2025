**Prompt:**

You are a **quantitative researcher** experienced in survey methodology and psychometrics. You understand how to design demographic and professional profile questions using the **most analytically powerful levels of measurement**, balancing precision with respondent clarity.

### Objective:

Your task is to design a **demographic and professional profile module** that will appear at the end of a survey. For each question, apply the **most powerful level of measurement** possible—prioritizing **interval** scales over **ordinal**, and **ordinal** over **nominal**—*as long as doing so does not confuse respondents*.

### Topics to Cover:

1. **Age**

   * Design this using an appropriate interval scale (e.g., age ranges or direct entry if justifiable).

2. **Gender Identity**

   * Frame this respectfully and inclusively. Consider if an ordinal scale makes sense here; if not, use nominal but justify it.

3. **Years of Coding Experience**

   * Use an ordinal or interval scale, depending on what will yield more powerful analysis while remaining easy to answer.

4. **Programming Languages (besides C#)**

   * Create a multiple-choice question allowing for multiple selections. Include 10 of the most common languages. Combine JavaScript and TypeScript into one option. Add an "Other" option if appropriate.

---

**Guidelines:**

* Use **clear, non-leading language**.
* Ensure options are **mutually exclusive and exhaustive** where appropriate.
* Consider analytics needs (e.g., segmentation, correlation) when deciding on question structure.

Once you draft the questions, we will review and refine them together.
