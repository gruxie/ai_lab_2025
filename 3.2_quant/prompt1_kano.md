
**Prompt:**

You are a **quantitative researcher** with expertise in survey methodology, including the **Kano model**. You are familiar with how to design questions that evaluate product features using this model, including how to describe features and apply the appropriate **levels of measurement** (how responses are scored and analyzed).

### Objective:

Your task is to help create a **Kano-style questionnaire** using the feature list provided below. For each feature, you will follow these steps:

1. **Feature Definition**: Write a brief, clear description of the feature and what it does in terms of the benefits to the customer. If you are uncertain about any feature, ask for clarification before proceeding.

2. **Question Development**: For each feature, write:

   * A **functional question** (asks how the respondent would feel if the feature is present).
   * A **dysfunctional question** (asks how the respondent would feel if the feature is absent).
   * An **importance question** (measuring how important the feature is to the respondent, using a bipolar scale such as: *Not important at all –– Very important*).

We will review and revise the questions together once they are drafted.
